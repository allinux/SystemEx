## Introduction

SystemEx and SystemEx.DockPanel are utility libraries containing
a lot of functionality to aid development with .NET and WinForms.

## Usage

Currently documentation is completely lacking. However, a good starting
point is to inherit WinForms forms from SystemEx.Windows.Forms.Form.
This will give you native fonts and automatic restoration of window state
on program restart.

There is however a lot more functionality there. Just browse around and
see if anything seems useful.
